- 👋 Hi, I’m @t-j-harrington
- 👀 I’m interested in documentation, natural language processing, and open source projects. I work as a technical writer for a cloud software company, and also as a freelance JA > EN translator.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python and APIs (for API documentation).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that need a documentation specialist, or any Japanese projects that need help with localization.
- 📫 You can reach me via GitHub or at office@tjharrington.co.uk
