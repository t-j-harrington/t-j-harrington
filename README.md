- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Harrington.
- 👀 I’m interested in documentation, natural language processing, and open source projects. I work as a technical writer, with a background in SaaS, Fintech, and APIs. I also work as a freelance JA > EN translator.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about web development..
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects that need a documentation specialist, or any Japanese projects that need help with localization.
- 📫 You can reach me via GitHub or at tomhazz@gmail.com
